<h3>Internet Presence</h3>
<p>
    I could be found at many places online. I have a Twitter account, but I don't use Facebook. 
    I am on Quora too. I'm on Freenode IRC as <i>xuanrui</i>, and I'm most active 
    on the <i>&#35;haskell</i>, <i>&#35;idris</i> and <i>&#35;ocaml</i> channels.

<h3>Thing I do when I don't do computing</h3>
<h4>Reading</h4>
<p>
I don't read much fiction, but I do read some history, cultural studies, and political theory books. Recently, 
though, I started reading Murakami's <i>Norwegian Wood</i> in the original to improve my Japanese langauge skills &mdash;
it has been OK by far.</p>

<h4>Paradox Interactive</h4>
<p>
I'm a fan of nearly all Paradox Interactive titles, especially <i>Europa Universalis 4</i>, <i>Hearts of Iron 4</i>, and 
<i>Crusader Kings II</i>.</p>

<h4>Music</h4>
<p>
    I listen to a lot of popular music, especially pop rock and technopop. Particularly, I listen to a lot of Japanese popular music.
