<h2>Personal</h2><br>
<h4>Residency</h4>
<p>
    I live in the Boston suburb of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerville%2C_Massachusetts">Somerviile, 
    Massachusetts</a>, near Tufts University, where I go to school. Somerville is a very 
    nice suburb, and Boston is a great place for living (minus the winters) in general.
</p>
<p>
    Previous to coming to the US for college, I lived in the port city of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a>, also known as the 
    "Silicon Valley of China", for almost my entire life.
</p><br>

<h4>Travel</h4>
<p>
    I'm enthusiastic about travelling, although I frequently find myself having little 
    time to travel. Some of my past destinations include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Seattle: although I had little time to see the city, I can feel that 
        Seattle is a nice city in almost all respects. It's nice, vibrant but not 
        too much so, and has a great physical surroding - the mountains of Washington.
    </li>
    <li>New York City: I guess this needs little extra explanation.</li>
    <li>Tokyo: another place that needs little extra explanation.</li>
    <li>
        Sapporo, Hokkaido: Sapporo is much like Boston and rather snowy, but it has a 
        much more larger night life scene.
    </li>
    <li>
        Shanghai: well, although very similar NYC and Tokyo it is, Shanghai has a 
        more "commonplace" taste to it, e.g., try out the small eateries during breakfast 
        time!
    </li>
    <li>
        Yunnan, China: one of the popular destinations for tourism and one of 
        my favorites. Yunnan is full of the beauty of nature, different ethnic 
        cultures, and exotic food, but if you are unlucky and unwitting you could 
        run into danger, scams or other kinds of trouble!
    </li>
    <li>
        Australia: Australia is distant and somewhat different from all other parts 
        of the world. Life there is very laid-back and animals are a more common scene 
        than in practically everywhere else.
    </li>
    <li>
        Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, and Berlin: I have been there, but it was really many 
        years ago and I remember little of that. I have plans to revisit them though.
    </li>
</ul><br>

<h4>Reading</h4>
<p>
    I don't read much fiction, but I like to read nonfiction. Here are some of my 
    more recent reads:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Yoshiwara: The Glittering World of the Japanese Courtesan</i> by Cecilia 
    Segawa Siegle</li>
    <li><i>Sayonara Amerika, Sayonara Nippon: A Geopolitical Prehistory of J-pop</i> by 
    Michael K. Bourdaghs</li>
    <li><i>A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right</i> by 
    Karl Marx</li>
    <li><i>The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci</i> by Jonathan D. Spence</li>
    <li><i>The Search for Modern China</i> by Jonathan D. Spence (I would especially 
    recommend this; Spence is a rather good writer about Chinese history)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I also like to read poetry from time to time. I read a lot from <i>Book of Odes</i>, 
    and I also read quite a lot early modern English poetry (e.g., William Shakespeare and 
    Lord Byron). I also like the works of three Nobel laureate poets, Sir Rudyard Kipling, 
    Rabindranath Tagore, and Wislawa Szymborska (it's a pity that I don't know either Bengali 
    or Polish and could only read their works in translation). The haiku master Matsuo 
    Basho's works are part of my more recent discoveries. 
</p><br>

<h4>Music</h4>
<p>
    I'm no expert on music, but I do have some preferences. For classical music, I like 
    Baroque era works, Frederic Chopin's beautiful piano music, and Giacomo Puccini's 
    operas.
</p>
<p>
    I like to listen to Asian popular music as well. As for Taiwanese/Chinese pop, I enjoy 
    Faye Wong, Jay Chou, Stefanie Yanzi Sun, and S.H.E's music. For J-Pop, artists such 
    as Kubota Saki, Arai Yumi (Matsutoya Yumi), Moritaka Chisato, Utada Hikaru, Perfume, 
    Ikimonokagari and ÅŒtsuka Ai are among my favorites.
</p><br>

<h4>Internet Presence</h4>
<p>
    I could be found at many places online. I have a Twitter account, but I don't use Facebook. 
    I also answer questions on Stack Exchange and Zhihu (the Chinese equivalent of 
    Quora) rather often; I am on Quora too. I'm on Freenode IRC as <i>xuanruiqi</i>.
