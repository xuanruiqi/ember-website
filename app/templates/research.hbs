        Elephant Tracks II is a dynamic analysis framework for memory in managed 
        programming languages which works by generating a <i>memory trace</i>, i.e. 
        record of object allocations, pointer traces, and object deaths. It is known 
        that you can do <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2259010">many</a>
        <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3133854">things</a> with those traces, 
        and the Elephant Tracks II project attempts to bring the utility of memory tracing 
        to more programmers, and to make memory tracing even greater.<br><br>
        We are <a href="https://github.com/ElephantTracksProject">on GitHub</a>!

  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">
        We have memory traces now, but what are we going to do with those trillion-line plain text 
        documents? An intuitive approach would be to <i>visualize</i> them. With two other undergraduates
        at Tufts Computer Science, we try to develop good 
        visual representations of memory traces using visualization, data mining and artificial 
        intelligence techniques.
