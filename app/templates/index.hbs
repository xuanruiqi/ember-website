<h2>About Me</h2><br>
<p>
    I am Xuanrui Qi, a junior at <a href="http://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a>, majoring in
    <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/">computer science</a> and
    <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/ir/">international relations</a>, and minoring in
    <a href="http://math.tufts.edu">mathematics</a>. I am an aspiring computer scientist,
    determined to bridge the gap between technology and society, as well as a political scientist
    in the making, a frequent traveller, and a person inspired by a kaleidoscope of
    different cultures.
